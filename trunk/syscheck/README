README for system check scripts.

Written by Philip Vendil philip@primekey.se 2006-05-17

The system check scripts controlls the overall health of the system
and sends it's result to syslog for further processing

The main script is 'systemcheck.sh' that performs all subsystem checks with
a filename starting with "sc_" in the script directory. If one of the
subsystem checks shouldn't be performed, remove it from the directory.

The script 'console_systemcheck.sh' performs the same checks but echoes
the output to the terminal instead of syslog.
