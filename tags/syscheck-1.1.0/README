DESCRIPTION
---------------------------
The system check scripts controls the overall health of the system
and sends it's result to syslog for further processing

The main script is 'systemcheck.sh' that performs all subsystem checks with
a filename starting with "sc_" in the scripts-enebled directory. 

The script 'console_systemcheck.sh' performs the same checks but echoes
the output to the terminal instead of syslog.

All message are described in lang/syscheck.<lang>
errorcodes are defined in the local sc_file 
defines that may be useful to more than the local script resides in resources.sh


INSTALLATION
---------------------------
untar the distribution in a suitable directory (default /usr/local/syscheck).
Then edit resource.sh to fit your needs.

by default a subset of scripts are enabled by having a link in "scripts-enabled" to "scripts-available" where all 
scripts reside, if you want all script enabled go to "scripts-enabled" and make links to "scripts-available"
eg: cd scripts-enabled ; ln -s ../scripts-available/sc_01_disk_usage.sh .

make a test-run by doing: ./console_systemcheck.sh if it works out good (All is OK), then go ahead and try
./systemsheck.sh then check your syslog-logs 

We've been running with the TCP feature of syslog-ng for a higer level of reliability for som time now, it works nice.

HELP
---------------------------
Description of each subcheck script:

Run: ./scripts-available/sc_nn_foo.sh --help
Eg: ./scripts-available/sc_04_pcsc_readers.sh --help
