Passive server monitoring

this is a simple server monitoring function, it has two major parts, one "client" that sends "I'm alive" messages to a "logserver" that checks that you get messages every now and then.

The "client" part:

lang/19.english	- language file for the sc-script that sends messages to central log server
config/19.conf - config file for the sc-script that sends messages to central log server
scripts-available/sc_19_alive.sh - the sc-script that sends messages to central log server

The "logserver" part
lang/918.english - language file for the monitoring script at the cental log server
config/918.conf - config file for the monitoring script at the cental log server
related-available/918_server_alive.sh - the monitoring script at the cental log server
